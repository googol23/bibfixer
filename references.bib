Results are given for the rms uncertainty in momentum and direction, and their correlation, for uniform weighting, and both uniform spacing and clustering of the measured points. It is shown that for measurement errors, clustering of measured points at the beginning, end, and center of the track leads to lower rms uncertainties. Estimates of the effect of multiple scattering include the contribution of single and plural small angle scattering outside the central Gaussian region. The contribution of atomic electrons to the multiple scattering is treated separately. In addition the effect of small angle nuclear scattering is included. Some numerical results are presented for a variety of projectiles in liquid hydrogen and propane chambers.}

@article{Gross2023,
   abstract = {Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory of quarks and gluons, whose interactions can be described by a local SU(3) gauge symmetry with charges called “color quantum numbers”, is reviewed; the goal of this review is to provide advanced Ph.D. students a comprehensive handbook, helpful for their research. When QCD was “discovered” 50 years ago, the idea that quarks could exist, but not be observed, left most physicists unconvinced. Then, with the discovery of charmonium in 1974 and the explanation of its excited states using the Cornell potential, consisting of the sum of a Coulomb-like attraction and a long range linear confining potential, the theory was suddenly widely accepted. This paradigm shift is now referred to as the November revolution. It had been anticipated by the observation of scaling in deep inelastic scattering, and was followed by the discovery of gluons in three-jet events. The parameters of QCD include the running coupling constant, $$\alpha _s(Q^2)$$, that varies with the energy scale $$Q^2$$characterising the interaction, and six quark masses. QCD cannot be solved analytically, at least not yet, and the large value of $$\alpha _s$$at low momentum transfers limits perturbative calculations to the high-energy region where $$Q^2\gg \varLambda _\{\{\textrm\{QCD\}\}\} ^2\simeq $$(250 MeV)$$^2$$. Lattice QCD (LQCD), numerical calculations on a discretized space-time lattice, is discussed in detail, the dynamics of the QCD vacuum is visualized, and the expected spectra of mesons and baryons are displayed. Progress in lattice calculations of the structure of nucleons and of quantities related to the phase diagram of dense and hot (or cold) hadronic matter are reviewed. Methods and examples of how to calculate hadronic corrections to weak matrix elements on a lattice are outlined. The wide variety of analytical approximations currently in use, and the accuracy of these approximations, are reviewed. These methods range from the Bethe-Salpeter, Dyson-Schwinger coupled relativistic equations, which are formulated in both Minkowski or Euclidean spaces, to expansions of multi-quark states in a set of basis functions using light-front coordinates, to the AdS/QCD method that imbeds 4-dimensional QCD in a 5-dimensional deSitter space, allowing confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking to be described in a novel way. Models that assume the number of colors is very large, i.e. make use of the large $$N_c$$-limit, give unique insights. Many other techniques that are tailored to specific problems, such as perturbative expansions for high energy scattering or approximate calculations using the operator product expansion are discussed. The very powerful effective field theory techniques that are successful for low energy nuclear systems (chiral effective theory), or for non-relativistic systems involving heavy quarks, or the treatment of gluon exchanges between energetic, collinear partons encountered in jets, are discussed. The spectroscopy of mesons and baryons has played an important historical role in the development of QCD. The famous X,Y,Z states - and the discovery of pentaquarks - have revolutionized hadron spectroscopy; their status and interpretation are reviewed as well as recent progress in the identification of glueballs and hybrids in light-meson spectroscopy. These exotic states add to the spectrum of expected $$q\{\{\bar\{q\}\}\}$$mesons and qqq baryons. The progress in understanding excitations of light and heavy baryons is discussed. The nucleon as the lightest baryon is discussed extensively, its form factors, its partonic structure and the status of the attempt to determine a three-dimensional picture of the parton distribution. An experimental program to study the phase diagram of QCD at high temperature and density started with fixed target experiments in various laboratories in the second half of the 1980s, and then, in this century, with colliders. QCD thermodynamics at high temperature became accessible to LQCD, and numerical results on chiral and deconfinement transitions and properties of the deconfined and chirally restored form of strongly interacting matter, called the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), have become very precise by now. These results can now be confronted with experimental data that are sensitive to the nature of the phase transition. There is clear evidence that the QGP phase is created. This phase of QCD matter can already be characterized by some properties that indicate, within a temperature range of a few times the pseudocritical temperature, the medium behaves like a near ideal liquid. Experimental observables are presented that demonstrate deconfinement. High and ultrahigh density QCD matter at moderate and low temperatures shows interesting features and new phases that are of astrophysical relevance. They are reviewed here and some of the astrophysical implications are discussed. Perturbative QCD and methods to describe the different aspects of scattering processes are discussed. The primary parton-parton scattering in a collision is calculated in perturbative QCD with increasing complexity. The radiation of soft gluons can spoil the perturbative convergence, this can be cured by resummation techniques, which are also described here. Realistic descriptions of QCD scattering events need to model the cascade of quark and gluon splittings until hadron formation sets in, which is done by parton showers. The full event simulation can be performed with Monte Carlo event generators, which simulate the full chain from the hard interaction to the hadronic final states, including the modelling of non-perturbative components. The contribution of the LEP experiments (and of earlier collider experiments) to the study of jets is reviewed. Correlations between jets and the shape of jets had allowed the collaborations to determine the “color factors” - invariants of the SU(3) color group governing the strength of quark-gluon and gluon-gluon interactions. The calculated jet production rates (using perturbative QCD) are shown to agree precisely with data, for jet energies spanning more than five orders of magnitude. The production of jets recoiling against a vector boson, $$W^\pm $$or Z, is shown to be well understood. The discovery of the Higgs boson was certainly an important milestone in the development of high-energy physics. The couplings of the Higgs boson to massive vector bosons and fermions that have been measured so far support its interpretation as mass-generating boson as predicted by the Standard Model. The study of the Higgs boson recoiling against hadronic jets (without or with heavy flavors) or against vector bosons is also highlighted. Apart from the description of hard interactions taking place at high energies, the understanding of “soft QCD” is also very important. In this respect, Pomeron - and Odderon - exchange, soft and hard diffraction are discussed. Weak decays of quarks and leptons, the quark mixing matrix and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon are processes which are governed by weak interactions. However, corrections by strong interactions are important, and these are reviewed. As the measured values are incompatible with (most of) the predictions, the question arises: are these discrepancies first hints for New Physics beyond the Standard Model? This volume concludes with a description of future facilities or important upgrades of existing facilities which improve their luminosity by orders of magnitude. The best is yet to come!},

  abstract     = {Superconducting dipole magnet for the compressed baryonic matter (CBM) experiment at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR Project, Darmstadt, Germany) is developed in Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics of Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences (BINP, Novosibirsk). The dipole magnet has an aperture of 1.4 m × 1.8 m and a maximum magnetic field of 3.25 T. To ensure the reliable operation of the magnet, a wire with a high copper-non-copper ratio is required. To provide a copper-non-copper ratio as high as 7-10, the “wire-in-channel” technology is traditionally used, where the NbTi multifilament superconducting strand is soldered into a groove of copper channel with a cross-section of 3.25 mm × 2.02 mm. This paper presents the alternative technology for manufacturing a large cross-section NbTi wire for a CBM detector, which has a monolithic design with copper-non-copper ratio about 7.4. Test results indicate that critical current density (Jc) of monolithic NbTi wire exceeds Jc obtained by the “wire-in-channel” technology. Using the technology developed, more than 1 t of NbTi wire was produced with a cross-section of 3.25 mm × 2.02 mm and a total length of more than 30 km.},

                      huge data rates that can not be fully stored on the
                      currently available storage devices. Therefore the data flow
                      should be reduced by selecting those collisions that
                      potentially carry the information of the physics interest.
                      The future CBM experiment will have no simple criteria for
                      selecting such collisions and requires the full online
                      reconstruction of the collision topology including
                      reconstruction of short-lived particles.In this work the KF
                      Particle Finder package for online reconstruction and
                      selection of short-lived particles is proposed and
                      developed. It reconstructs more than 70 decays, covering
                      signals from all the physics cases of the CBM experiment:
                      strange particles, strange resonances, hypernuclei, low mass
                      vector mesons, charmonium, and open-charm particles.The
                      package is based on the Kalman filter method providing a
                      full set of the particle parameters together with their
                      errors including position, momentum, mass, energy, lifetime,
                      etc. It shows a high quality of the reconstructed particles,
                      high efficiencies, and high signal to background

                      a strong linear scalability on the many-core architectures

@article{Friese2017,
   abstract = {The Compressed Baryonic Matter experiment (CBM) is a next-generation heavy-ion experiment to be operated at the FAIR facility, currently under construction in Darmstadt, Germany. A key feature of CBM is very high interaction rate, exceeding those of contemporary nuclear collision experiments by several orders of magnitude. Such interaction rates forbid a conventional, hardware-triggered readout; instead, experiment data will be freely streaming from self-triggered front-end electronics. In order to reduce the huge raw data volume to a recordable rate, data will be selected exclusively on CPU, which necessitates partial event reconstruction in real-time. Consequently, the traditional segregation of online and offline software vanishes; an integrated on- and offline data processing concept is called for. In this paper, we will report on concepts and developments for computing for CBM as well as on the status of preparations for its first physics run.},

$ dileptons,
@article{Rapp2016,
   abstract = {Thermal dilepton radiation from the hot fireballs created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions provides unique insights into the properties of the produced medium. We first show how the predictions of hadronic many-body theory for a melting $\rho$ meson, coupled with quark-gluon plasma emission utilizing a modern lattice-QCD based equation of state, yield a quantitative description of dilepton spectra in heavy-ion collisions at the SPS and the RHIC beam energy scan program. We utilize these results to systematically extract the excess yields and their invariant-mass spectral slopes to predict the excitation function of fireball lifetimes and (early) temperatures, respectively. We thereby demonstrate that future measurements of these quantities can yield unprecedented information on basic fireball properties. Specifically, our predictions quantify the relation between the measured and maximal fireball temperature, and the proportionality of excess yield and total lifetime. This information can serve as a “caloric” curve to search for a first-order QCD phase transition, and to detect non-monotonous lifetime variations possibly related to critical phenomena.},

@article{Hohler2014,
   abstract = {Utilizing in-medium vector spectral functions which describe dilepton data in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of QCD and Weinberg sum rules at finite temperature. The starting point is our recent study in vacuum, where the sum rules have been quantitatively satisfied using phenomenological vector and axial-vector spectral functions which describe hadronic τ-decay data. In the medium, the temperature dependence of condensates and chiral order parameters is taken from thermal lattice QCD where available, and otherwise is estimated from a hadron resonance gas. Since little is known about the in-medium axial-vector spectral function, we model it with a Breit-Wigner ansatz allowing for smooth temperature variations of its width and mass parameters. Our study thus amounts to testing the compatibility of the $\rho$-broadening found in dilepton experiments with (the approach toward) chiral restoration, and thereby searching for viable in-medium axial-vector spectral functions.},

The feasibility to detect this effect clearly in the dilepton mass spectrum is examined.

Designs covering many square meters with millions of signal channels are now commonplace in high-energy physics and the technology is finding its way into many other fields, ranging from astrophysics to experiments at synchrotron light sources and medical imaging. This book presents a discussion of the many facets of highly integrated semiconductor detector systems, covering sensors, signal processing, transistors, circuits, low-noise electronics, and radiation effects. To lay a basis for the more detailed discussions in the book and aid in understanding how these different elements combine to form functional detector systems, the text includes introductions to semiconductor physics, diodes, detectors, signal formation, transistors, amplifier circuits, electronic noise mechanisms, and signal processing. A chapter on digital electronics includes key elements of analog-to-digital converters and an introduction to digital signal processing. The physics of radiation damage in semiconductor devices is discussed and applied to detectors and electronics. The diversity of design approaches is illustrated in a chapter describing systems in high-energy physics, astronomy, and astrophysics. Finally, a chapter ‘Why things don't work’, discusses common pitfalls, covering interference mechanisms such as power supply noise, microphonics, and shared current paths (‘ground loops’), together with mitigation techniques for pickup noise reduction, both at the circuit and system level. Beginning at a basic level, the book provides a unique introduction to a key area of modern science.},

The silicon detector used in this test is made of double sided microstrip sensors coupled to a front-end electronics, both used in the AMSO1 experiment [Alcaraz et al.,]. Using betas from [SUP90]Sr source, placed on top of the active area of the silicon, and a plastic scintillator coupled to a photomultiplier, it is possible to trigger the readout system of the silicon detector. The setup of the silicon detector system is described and the performance results are analyzed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

This system needs to meet the requirements of the CBM time-of-flight (ToF) measurement system for both proton and heavy ion beams, while also serving as part of the fast beam abort system. To achieve these goals, a detector based on chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond technology has been proposed. In addition, new developments using Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are currently under evaluation. This contribution presents the current development status of the beam detector concept for the CBM experiment.},

A pilot experiment was performed utilizing transverse emittance exchange to reduce the beam size in the extraction plane, and the improvement of spill micro structure was found. Important beam instrumentation comprises an Ionization Profile Monitor for beam profile measurement inside the synchrotron and a plastic scintillator at the external transfer line for ion counting with up to several 106 particles per second and 20 µs time slices. The performant data acquisition systems, including a scaler and a fast Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC), allow for determining the spill quality. The application of the TDC in the measurements and related MAD-X simulations are discussed.},

   abstract = {The synchrotron SIS18 at GSI uses resonant extraction for slow beam extraction on the order of seconds. For some time, there has been an unexplained discrepancy of the slow extraction with a lower extraction efficiency than expected at the highest beam energies. Recent machine studies have indicated that the deflection by the electrostatic septum might be less than the nominal 2.5 mrad, leading to increased losses at the magnetic septum. In this paper we pursue an idea to directly measure the voltage of the electrode gap by utilizing the fact that dark current electrons accelerated in the gap of the electrostatic extraction septum generate Bremsstrahlung X-rays when hitting the anode. The high-energy cutoff of the X-ray spectra then corresponds to the voltage of the electrode gap. Measurements of the X-ray spectra at the extraction septum of SIS18 have been performed using a solid state CdTe detector. This technique provides an in-situ measurement of the voltage applied to the electrostatic extraction channel, and has proven to be a useful diagnostics tool.},

The Silicon Tracking System (STS) is the central detector for momentum reconstruction of the produced charged particles in the CBM experiment. It consists of 8 layers of altogether ∼ 900 double sided silicon micro strip sensors. Limited mechanical precision(> 100μm) during the mounting, temperature differences during the experiment, influence of the applied magnetic field result in misalignment to the detector component positions. Therefore, the intrinsic spatial resolution(∼ 20μm) of the detector components has to be recovered by a track based alignment method. In this conference paper, the current status of implementation of the alignment algorithm is presented. For this work, the GBL (General broken line) track refit model is employed to create the necessary input data structure to provide the input to the standalone PEDE part of the χ2 minimization based MILLEPEDE II alignment algorithm.},

The detector comprise eight layers of double-sided silicon micro-strip sensors and will be placed inside the 1 Tm superconducting magnet which limits the space available, which in turn requires advanced cooling approaches and mechanical design with precise tracking layers alignment. The micro-strip sensors have to be radiation hard and checked for their quality optically and electrically before the assembly.

Cross section and scattering measurements are important in order to provide accurate basic data for the treatment planning system. Using several planes of a high spatial resolution vertex detector based on monolithic CMOS pixel sensor technology is a common concept for measuring precise trajectories of charged particles before and after interactions. To reach high spatial resolution, the alignment of the sensors is mandatory. In this work, an alignment procedure based on a global χ 2 cost function, that simultaneously optimizes the alignment parameters for all events is presented and shows accurate results which allows the detectors to reach high spatial resolution. The procedure was benchmarked with simulated and experimental data for the MIMOSA28 pixel detector and compared to a state of the art alignment algorithm. The results of the alignment were in agreement with the requirements needed for precise measurements in particle therapy. The spatial resolution reached after the alignment was better than 10μm.},

@article{FrieseClusterFinding2019,
   abstract = {In position-sensitive detectors with segmented readout (pixels or strips), charged particles activate in general several adjacent read-out channels. The first step in the reconstruction of the hit position is thus to identify clusters of active channels associated to one particle crossing the detector. In conventionally triggered systems, where the association of raw data to events is given by a hardware trigger, this is an easy-to-solve problem. It, however, becomes more involved in untriggered, free-streaming read-out systems like the one employed by the CBM experiment. Here, the time coordinate of the single-channel measurement must be taken into account to decider whether neighbouring active channels belong to a cluster. A simple extension of well-known cluster finding algorithms is not satisfactory because of involving increasing combinatorics, which are prohibitive for reconstruction in real-time. In this article, a cluster-finding solution for the Silicon Tracking System of the CBM experiment is presented which avoids any combinatorics or loops over detector channels. Its execution time is thus independent on the size of the data packages (time slices) delivered by the data acquisition, making it suitable for being used in online reconstruction.},

The unique feature of CBM will be an unprecedented rate capability for heavy-ion collisions (10 MHz interaction rate) at beam energies which produce maximal baryonic densities. The detector system for momentum determination is a complex, multilayer Silicon Tracking System (STS). The key challenges of this detector system are the requirement to keep the material budget to a minimum and to be able to operate in a high radiation field.},

   abstract = {The Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) will be the accelerator-based flagship research facility in many basic sciences and their applications in Europe for the coming decades. FAIR will open up unprecedented research opportunities in hadron and nuclear physics, in atomic physics and nuclear astrophysics as well as in applied sciences like materials research, plasma physics and radiation biophysics with applications towards novel medical treatments and space science. FAIR is currently under construction as an international facility at the campus of the GSI Helmholtzzentrum for Heavy-Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. While the full science potential of FAIR can only be harvested once the new suite of accelerators and storage rings is completed and operational, some of the experimental detectors and instrumentation are already available and will be used starting in summer 2018 in a dedicated research program at GSI, exploiting also the significantly upgraded GSI accelerator chain. The current manuscript summarizes how FAIR will advance our knowledge in various research fields ranging from a deeper understanding of the fundamental interactions and symmetries in nature to a better understanding of the evolution of the Universe and the objects within.},

Instead, CBM will ship and collect time-stamped data into a readout buffer in a form of a time-slice of a certain length and deliver it to a large computer farm, where online event reconstruction and selection will be performed. Grouping measurements into physical collisions must be performed in software and requires reconstruction not only in space, but also in time, the so-called 4-dimensional track reconstruction and event building. The tracks, reconstructed with 4D Cellular Automaton track finder, are combined into event-corresponding clusters according to the estimated time in the target position and the errors, obtained with the Kalman Filter method. The reconstructed events are given as inputs to the KF Particle Finder package for short-lived particle reconstruction. The results of time-based reconstruction of simulated collisions in CBM are presented and discussed in details.},

In this report, we describe the implementation of the Silicon Tracking System (STS), the main tracking device of the CBM experiment, in the CBM software environment. The STS makes uses of double-sided silicon micro-strip sensors with double metal layers. We present a description of transport and detector response simulation, including all relevant physical effects like charge creation and drift, charge collection, cross-talk and digitization. Of particular importance and novelty is the description of the time behaviour of the detector, since its readout will not be externally triggered but continuous. We also cover some aspects of local reconstruction, which in the CBM case has to be performed in real-time and thus requires high-speed algorithms.},

   abstract = {Substantial experimental and theoretical efforts worldwide are devoted to explore the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. At LHC and top RHIC energies, QCD matter is studied at very high temperatures and nearly vanishing net-baryon densities. There is evidence that a Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) was created at experiments at RHIC and LHC. The transition from the QGP back to the hadron gas is found to be a smooth cross over. For larger net-baryon densities and lower temperatures, it is expected that the QCD phase diagram exhibits a rich structure, such as a first-order phase transition between hadronic and partonic matter which terminates in a critical point, or exotic phases like quarkyonic matter. The discovery of these landmarks would be a breakthrough in our understanding of the strong interaction and is therefore in the focus of various high-energy heavy-ion research programs. The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at FAIR will play a unique role in the exploration of the QCD phase diagram in the region of high net-baryon densities, because it is designed to run at unprecedented interaction rates. High-rate operation is the key prerequisite for high-precision measurements of multi-differential observables and of rare diagnostic probes which are sensitive to the dense phase of the nuclear fireball. The goal of the CBM experiment at SIS100 ($\sqrt\{s_\{NN\}\}=$2.7--4.9 GeV) is to discover fundamental properties of QCD matter: the phase structure at large baryon-chemical potentials ( $\mu_B > 500$MeV), effects of chiral symmetry, and the equation of state at high density as it is expected to occur in the core of neutron stars. In this article, we review the motivation for and the physics programme of CBM, including activities before the start of data taking in 2024, in the context of the worldwide efforts to explore high-density QCD matter.},

   abstract = {Charged-particle production was studied in proton-proton collisions collected
at the LHC with the ALICE detector at centre-of-mass energies 0.9 TeV and 2.36
TeV in the pseudorapidity range |$\eta$| < 1.4. In the central region (|$\eta$|
< 0.5), at 0.9 TeV, we measure charged-particle pseudorapidity density
dNch/deta = 3.02 $\pm$ 0.01 (stat.) $^\{+0.08\}_\{-0.05\}$ (syst.) for inelastic
interactions, and dNch/deta = 3.58 $\pm$ 0.01 (stat.) $^\{+0.12\}_\{-0.12\}$
(syst.) for non-single-diffractive interactions. At 2.36 TeV, we find dNch/deta
= 3.77 $\pm$ 0.01 (stat.) $^\{+0.25\}_\{-0.12\}$ (syst.) for inelastic, and
dNch/deta = 4.43 $\pm$ 0.01 (stat.) $^\{+0.17\}_\{-0.12\}$ (syst.) for
non-single-diffractive collisions. The relative increase in charged-particle
multiplicity from the lower to higher energy is 24.7% $\pm$ 0.5% (stat.)
$^\{+5.7\}_\{-2.8\}$% (syst.) for inelastic and 23.7% $\pm$ 0.5% (stat.)
$^\{+4.6\}_\{-1.1\}$% (syst.) for non-single-diffractive interactions. This
increase is consistent with that reported by the CMS collaboration for
non-single-diffractive events and larger than that found by a number of
commonly used models. The multiplicity distribution was measured in different
pseudorapidity intervals and studied in terms of KNO variables at both
energies. The results are compared to proton-antiproton data and to model
predictions.},

   abstract = {Pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles emitted in $Au+Au$, $Cu+Cu$, $d+Au$, and $p+p$ collisions over a wide energy range have been measured using the PHOBOS detector at RHIC. The centrality dependence of both the charged particle distributions and the multiplicity at midrapidity were measured. Pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles emitted with $|\eta|<5.4$, which account for between 95% and 99% of the total charged-particle emission associated with collision participants, are presented for different collision centralities. Both the midrapidity density, $dN_\{ch\}/d\eta$, and the total charged-particle multiplicity, $N_\{ch\}$, are found to factorize into a product of independent functions of collision energy, $\sqrt\{s_\{_\{NN\}\}\}$, and centrality given in terms of the number of nucleons participating in the collision, $N_\{part\}$. The total charged particle multiplicity, observed in these experiments and those at lower energies, assumes a linear dependence of $(\ln s_\{_\{NN\}\})^2$ over the full range of collision energy of $\sqrt\{s_\{_\{NN\}\}\}$=2.7-200 GeV.},

@article{ALICE2009_PbPb,
   abstract = {On 23rd November 2009, during the early commissioning of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), two counter-rotating proton bunches were circulated for the first time concurrently in the machine, at the LHC injection energy of 450 GeV per beam. Although the proton intensity was very low, with only one pilot bunch per beam, and no systematic attempt was made to optimize the collision optics, all LHC experiments reported a number of collision candidates. In the ALICE experiment, the collision region was centred very well in both the longitudinal and transverse directions and 284 events were recorded in coincidence with the two passing proton bunches. The events were immediately reconstructed and analyzed both online and offline. We have used these events to measure the pseudorapidity density of charged primary particles in the central region. In the range |$\eta$| < 0.5, we obtain dNch/deta = 3.10 $\pm$ 0.13 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.22 (syst.) for all inelastic interactions, and dNch/deta = 3.51 $\pm$ 0.15 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.25 (syst.) for non-single diffractive interactions. These results are consistent with previous measurements in proton-antiproton interactions at the same centre-of-mass energy at the CERN SppS collider. They also illustrate the excellent functioning and rapid progress of the LHC accelerator, and of both the hardware and software of the ALICE experiment, in this early start-up phase.},

The fixed target experiment will explore the nuclear fireballs created in violent heavy ion reactions with a rich number of probes. To reconstruct the decay topologies of open-charm particles as well as to track low-momentum particles, an ultra-light and precise Microvertex Detector (MVD) is required. The necessary performance in terms of spatial resolution, material budget and rate capability will be reached by equipping the MVD with highly granular, radiation-hard CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (CPS) developped at IPHC Strasbourg, which are operated in the target vacuum of the experiment.  This contribution introduces the concept of the MVD and puts a focus on the latest results obtained from the R&D of the electronics and read-out chain of the device. Moreover, we briefly introduce the PRESTO project, which realises a prototype of a full size quadrant of an MVD detector station.},

   abstract = {In CBM Experiment at FAIR, dimuons will be detected by a Muon Chamber (MUCH) consisting of segmented absorbers of varying widths and tracking chambers sandwiched between the absorber-pairs. In this fixed target heavy-ion collision experiment, operating at highest interaction rate of 10MHz for Au+Au collision, the inner region of the 1st detector will face a particle rate of 1MHz/cm2. To operate at such a high particle density, GEM technology based detectors have been selected for the first two stations of MUCH. We have reported earlier the performance of several small-size GEM detector prototypes built at VECC for use in MUCH. In this work, we report on a large GEM prototype tested with proton beam of momentum 2.36GeV/c at COSY-Jülich Germany. The detector was read out using nXYTER operated in self-triggering mode. An efficiency higher than 96% at ΔVGEM=375.2V was achieved. The variation of efficiency with the rate of incoming protons has been found to vary within 2% when tested up to a maximum rate of 2.8MHz/cm2. The gain was found to be stable at high particle rate with a maximum variation of ∼9%.},

                      Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at FAIR. The
                      MuCh system is designed to identify muon pairs which are
                      produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions in the beam
                      energy range from 4 to 40 AGeV. The measurement of lepton
                      pairs is a central part of the CBM research program, as they
                      are very sensitive diagnostic probes of the conditions
                      inside the fireball. At low invariant masses, dileptons
                      provide information on the in-medium modification of vector
                      mesons which is a promising observable for the restoration
                      of chiral symmetry. At intermediate invariant masses, the
                      dilepton spectrum is dominated by thermal radiation from the
                      fireball reflecting its temperature. At invariant masses
                      around 3 GeV/c2, dileptons are the appropriate tool to study
                      the anomalous charmonium suppression in the deconfined
                      phase. In the CBM experiment both electrons and muons will
                      be measured in order to obtain a consistent and

                      the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at FAIR. The
                      main task of the TRD is to identify electrons above momenta
                      of 1 GeV/c and thus to extend the electron identification

                      above momenta of p ~ 5 GeV/c. This identification has to be
                      achieved with a pion suppression factor of about 20 at
                      $90\%$ electron efficiency, in order to allow for a

The prototypes are based on using low resistivity  (∼ 1010 Ω·cm) glass electrodes for performing in high counting rate environment. The strip width/pitch size was chosen such  to fulfill the impedance matching with the front-end electronics and the granularity requirements of the innermost zone of the CBM-TOF wall. The in-beam tests  using  secondary particles produced in heavy ion collisions on a Pb target at SIS18-GSI Darmstadt and SPS-CERN were focused on the performance of the prototypes in conditions similar to the ones expected at SIS100/FAIR. An efficiency larger than 98% and a system time resolution in the order of 70-80 ps were obtained in high counting rate and high multiplicity environment.}

However, the optimization of these networks has become more difficult as neural networks going deeper and datasets becoming bigger. Therefore, more advanced optimization algorithms have been proposed over the past years. In this study, widely used optimization algorithms for deep learning are examined in detail. To this end, these algorithms called adaptive gradient methods are implemented for both supervised and unsupervised tasks. The behavior of the algorithms during training and results on four image datasets, namely, MNIST, CIFAR-10, Kaggle Flowers and Labeled Faces in the Wild are compared by pointing out their differences against basic optimization algorithms. },
